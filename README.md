# Lem-in

### About Lem-in :

* The goal of this project is to move ants throughs multiple path.
* In this project, I need to find the path I can use and then move my ants in the best way possible
* Each time the program will move an ant it will print it as follow : Lx-room_name with x being the number of the ant. if multiple ants are moved at the same time, it will all be printed in one line.

### Map :

* The first part of the map is an integer which represent the number of ants we have in the starting room
* The second part of the map is the name of the room followed but it's coordinates x and y
* The ##start and ##end indicate that the room below is the starting/ending point
* The third and last part represent the link between the room
* The link between room must be formated as follow : room1_name-room2_name

### Map example :
